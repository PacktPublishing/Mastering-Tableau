# Mastering Tableau
This is the code repository for [Mastering Tableau](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-tableau?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781784397692), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter 2.


The code will look like the following:

     IF [Actual/Forecast] = "Actual"
     THEN SUM([World Indicators].[Country B Population])
     ELSE PREVIOUS_VALUE(0) * [Select Country B Forecast] + PREVIOUS_VALUE(0)
     END
     
### Software requirements:

* Chapter 2, All about Data - Getting Your Data Ready, makes light use of Adobe Acrobat.
Access to SQL Server is helpful in a few places, especially in Chapter 4, All about Data - Data Densification, Cubes, and Big Data.
* Chapter 7, Beyond the Basic Chart Types, assumes access to Inkscape to complete two exercises (Inkscape is an open source vector drawing application that is similar to Adobe Illustrator).
* Access to Tableau Server is helpful in a few places, especially Chapter 12, Interacting with Tableau Server, where permissions for publishing data sources and editing in the web authoring environment are assumed.
* Access to Rserve is assumed for Chapter 13, R Integration. RGui and RStudio are also helpful but not strictly required.
